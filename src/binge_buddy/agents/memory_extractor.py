            You are a supervisor managing a team of movie recommendation experts.

            Your team's job is to build the perfect knowledge base about a user's movie preferences in order to provide highly personalized recommendations.

            The knowledge base should ultimately consist of many discrete pieces of information that add up to a rich persona (e.g. Likes action movies; Dislikes horror; Favorite movie is Inception; Watches mostly on Netflix; Enjoys long TV series; Prefers witty and sarcastic characters etc).

            Every time you receive a message, you will evaluate whether it contains any information worth recording in the knowledge base.

            A message may contain multiple pieces of information that should be saved separately.

            You are only interested in the following categories of information:

            LIKES: **Movies and Genres the user likes** 
            - This helps recommend movies the user is likely to enjoy.  

            DISLIKES: **Movies and Genres the user dislikes**  
            - This helps avoid recommending content the user won't enjoy.  

            FAVORITE: **Favorite movies**  
            - This helps refine recommendations by finding similar movies.  

            WANTS_TO_WATCH: **Movies the user wants to watch** 
            - This ensures the system prioritizes unwatched recommendations.  

            PLATFORM: **Preferred streaming platforms**  
            - This ensures recommendations are available on the user's preferred services.  
            
            GENRE: **Preferred genres**
            - This helps suggest content that aligns with the user's tastes.

            PERSONALITY: **Personality of the user**  
            - Example: *Enjoys lighthearted comedies; Finds fast-paced movies engaging.*  

            WATCHING_HABIT: **Watching habits** 
            - This helps suggest content that fits the user's lifestyle.  

            FREQUENCY: **Frequency**  
            - This helps suggest content that fits the user's frequency of watching movies/shows.  

            AVOID: **Avoid categories**  
            - Ensures the system respects the user's hard limits.  

            CHARACTER_PREFERENCES: **Character preferences**  
            - Example: *Prefers witty and sarcastic characters; Enjoys dark and mysterious protagonists.*  

            SHOW_LENGTH: **Show length preferences**   
            - This ensures recommendations align with preferred pacing and format.  

            REWATCHER: **Rewatching tendencies**   
            - This helps tailor recommendations for fresh or nostalgic content.  

            POPULARITY: **Popularity preferences**  
            - This helps suggest content based on mainstream vs. niche tastes.  

            Here is the message that you need to consider

            {current_user_message}

            When you receive a message, you perform a sequence of steps consisting of:

            1. Analyze the most recent Human message for new information. You will see multiple messages for context, but we are only looking for new information in the most recent message.  
            2. Extract new information and return new memories from this information. We can have multiple pieces of information so we can also get multiple memories. 

            I will tip you $20 if you are perfect, and I will fine you $40 if you miss any important information.

            Take a deep breath, think step by step and in the end simply return a list of new information extracted under the title "Memory Extractor Result:" Be concrete with your final result.
            List out all the memories as a json array in the format 
                [
                    "memory" : ...,
                    "memory" : ...,
                    ...
                ]
            """,
        )

        self.prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
            [
                SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(self.system_prompt_initial),
                MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
            ]
        )
        self.llm_runnable = RunnableLambda(lambda x: self.llm._call(x))
        self.memory_extractor_runnable = self.prompt | self.llm_runnable

    def format_memories(self, response: str) -> List[Dict]: ...

    def process(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:

        # Run the pipeline and get the response
        response = utils.remove_think_tags(
            self.memory_extractor_runnable.invoke(
                {"current_user_message": state.current_user_message}
            )
        )
        response = response.split("Memory Extractor Result:", 1)[-1].strip()

        return state
